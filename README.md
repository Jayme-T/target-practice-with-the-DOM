##Target Practice

####The Javascript file will walk you through simply targeting an element, attaching an event handler to it, and adding an item to a list with that event.

The Javascript file will walk you through:
* Selecting elements in the DOM
* Manipulating those elements
* and creating new elements.

**This is (what I believe) to be a useful example of basic DOM manipulation**
